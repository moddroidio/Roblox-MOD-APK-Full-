CHAT WITH FRIENDS
Connect with your friends online using in-game chat features, private messages, and groups!

FREE-TO-PLAY
Roblox is free to play, but players can also use real money to purchase Robux (our virtual currency on Roblox) to spend on in-game upgrades or accessories for their avatar. Players can also purchase an optional “Builders Club” membership, which provides extra privileges and a daily Robux stipend (tap the “More” tab at the bottom of the screen in the app, and then “Builders Club” to learn more).

PLEASE NOTE: A network connection is required to play. Roblox games work best over Wi-Fi.

Hope that you enjoy this!
